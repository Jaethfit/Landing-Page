A portfolio demonstration of my HTML skills up to project one with The Odin Project.

This project features a business which, using NFTs, creates a unique snapshot of 
your dog that you can then share with others, communicate over, upload to custom 
electronic keychains, etc. There is a heavy social-media component which is not 
added yet, and a token-generation functionality that may never be added. And if you 
can't tell, this is (mostly) satire.
